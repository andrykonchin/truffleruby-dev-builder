# TruffleRuby Dev Builds for GitHub Actions

These builds are primarily meant to be used inside GitHub Actions with
[ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby).

They can also be used as nightly builds of TruffleRuby, see [the documentation](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/doc/user/standalone-distribution.md#latest-nightly-build).
